# SDNext-CONText

A set of *beta* context menus for use with [SDNext](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic) that allows for easy starting in various modes, troubleshooting, and maintenance.  
Additional features to come.
Requires [ShellAnything](https://github.com/end2endzone/ShellAnything) to be installed and registered first.

## Installation & Use

1. Place the xml file in your C:\user\username\shellanything folder.
2. Right click in your main sdnext folder, select SDNext menu, go to Install, then select **Set SDNext Home Dir** to set your path most other commands will utilize.
3. If you have a set of specific `--arguments` you always want to use with most other startups, select `Set SDNext Startup Defaults` and enter them as you would at the command line, `--debug --use-directml` etc.
